                <p>We at Frontliners Studio encourage you (also referred to as "the
                    user") to read and understand this
                    Privacy Policy. User data includes, but is not limited to, personally identifiable information, and
                    device
                    information. This page discusses how user data is handled when using "GG Screen Recorder"
                    (also referred to as "this app", or "the app"). This app does not require, collect, share, nor
                    transmit user data.
